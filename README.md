Smart Team Chat UI
This is a lightweight React prototype of a Smart Team Chat UI, built as a technical assignment. The goal is to demonstrate a modern, AI-first user interface that could enhance team communication by providing suggestions, summaries, and prompts. The focus is on a high-quality UI/UX and functional AI placeholders, without a real backend or chat integration.
